# Hi, I'm Luthfi! ðŸ‘‹

## ðŸš€ About Me
As a final-year Computer Science student at Diponegoro University, I have focused my interests and research on Back End Engineering and Blockchain/Web3 technologies. With a high level of enthusiasm and a strong commitment to advancing my career in the field of information technology, I have delved into in-depth coursework in Back End development, covering concepts such as databases and server-side scripting. Furthermore, my interest in Blockchain and Web3 reflects an awareness of the transformative potential of decentralized systems and the evolution of the internet. My experiences in various projects and potential involvement in extracurricular activities and internships have enriched my practical understanding. With the intention of pursuing a graduate program, I aim to deepen my knowledge, sharpen my skills, and explore new opportunities in my professional career in the field of information technology, particularly in the realm of Blockchain and Web3 technologies.
