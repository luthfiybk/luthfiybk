# Hi, I'm Luthfi! ðŸ‘‹

## ðŸš€ About Me
As a Computer Science graduate from Diponegoro University, I have focused my studies on Back End Engineering, with a strong emphasis on databases, server-side scripting, and scalable system architecture. My passion for Back End development is supported by my interest in expanding my knowledge in data and security, recognizing their critical importance in todayâ€™s IT landscape.

I have gained hands-on experience through a variety of projects, along with active involvement in extracurricular activities and internships, which have provided me with a solid practical foundation and a versatile skill set. Moving forward, I am eager to continue my education to enhance my expertise, refine my technical abilities, and embrace new opportunities in information technology, particularly in Back End development, data, and security.
